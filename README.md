### Feature included:
- Get user input (bank name, account number and password), and then fetch user's financial transactions by using Plaid API.
- Visualize user's consumption behaviour (location, category, monthly purchase amount and monthly transfer amount)


Data visualization is done by using the third-party library: https://github.com/philackm/Scrollable-GraphView
